## Overview

This repository contains a mathematical exposition of ElGamal encryption and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
from the perspective of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

Starting from a ring-theoretic formulation of ElGamal via unit groups of finite rings,
ECC is reformulated geometrically using elliptic curves as smooth projective group schemes.
A central theme is the interpretation of ECC as computation with endomorphisms and isogenies
of elliptic curves (End(E)), providing a conceptual bridge to isogeny-based cryptography.

## Intended Audience

This material is intended for readers with a background in mathematics, cryptography,
or formal methods, including researchers, students, and practitioners interested in
the structural foundations of elliptic curve cryptography and post-quantum approaches.
